#  📌ARP Spoofing Attack Demonstration

##  ⭐Demonstration of ARP Spoofing Attack in a Virtualised Network Environment

##  ⚪Overview
This project demonstrates an ARP Spoofing (ARP Poisoning) attack in a controlled virtual lab to highlight security weaknesses in the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP). Since ARP does not authenticate responses, it can be exploited to perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.
